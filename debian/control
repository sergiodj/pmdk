Package: librpmem1
Architecture: amd64
Multi-Arch: same
Depends: libpmem1 (= ${binary:Version}), ${misc:Depends}, ${shlibs:Depends}
Description: Persistent Memory remote access support library
 librpmem provides low-level support for remote access to persistent memory
 (pmem) utilizing RDMA-capable RNICs.  The library can be used to replicate
 remotely a memory region over RDMA protocol.  It utilizes appropriate
 persistency mechanism based on remote node’s platform capabilities.  The
 librpmem utilizes the ssh client to authenticate a user on remote node and for
 encryption of connection’s out-of-band configuration data.
 .
 This library is for applications that use remote persistent memory directly,
 without the help of any library-supplied transactions or memory allocation.
 Higher-level libraries that build on libpmem are available and are recommended
 for most applications.

Multi-Arch: foreign
Depends: ${misc:Depends}, ${shlibs:Depends}
Description: Persistent Memory management tools
 The main purpose of this package is to provide a user with a set of utilities
 for off-line analysis and manipulation of pools created by pmem libraries.
 .
 The utilities may be useful for troubleshooting by system administrators and
 for software developers who work on applications based on these libraries.  The
 latter may find these tools useful for testing and debugging purposes also.
